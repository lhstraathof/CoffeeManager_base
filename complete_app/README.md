# Description

The last few years *JavaScript* is dominating the rank list of *most popular* programming language on GitHub and StackOverflow. The market demand for Front-end Developers is at an all time high. And according to 'TheStateOfJS' React has taken the crown as its most popular framework.  
  
This workshop is for those who are new to React and those looking to get a better understanding of *React fundamentals*. In this workshop we are going to build an application together. So that when you leave you will understand what problems React can solve for you and how it goes about doing this. You will learn JSX, Styling, PropTypes, Managing State, Lifecycle, Events, Basic Tooling and other fundamentals. At the end of the course you will have a running application that you will deploy to the cloud.

A solid background as software developer is key and some knowledge about JavaScript will help but is not mandatory.
